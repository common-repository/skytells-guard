A comprehensive, user-friendly, all in one WordPress security and firewall plugin for your site.

== Description ==
= A COMPREHENSIVE, EASY TO USE, STABLE AND WELL SUPPORTED WORDPRESS SECURITY PLUGIN =

WordPress itself is a very secure platform. However, it helps to add some extra security and firewall to your site by using a security plugin that enforces a lot of good security practices.

The Skytells Guard plugin will take your website security to a whole new level.

This plugin is designed and written by experts and is easy to use and understand.

It reduces security risk by checking for vulnerabilities, and by implementing and enforcing the latest recommended WordPress security practices and techniques.



Skytells Guard also uses an unprecedented security points grading system to measure how well you are protecting your site based on the security features you have activated.

Our security and firewall rules are categorized into "basic", "intermediate" and "advanced". This way you can apply the firewall rules progressively without breaking your site's functionality.

The Skytells Guard plugin doesn't slow down your site.



Below is a list of the security and firewall features offered in this plugin:

= Face ID  - Facial Recognition =
* The Ultimate Protection for your website, Your Face is your Secured Password.
* Ability to Login with Skytells Enhanced AI FaceID with High-Level of Encryption
* Face ID Adds Extra Layer of Protection, So Your Face is your 2nd Factor Authentication
* Ability to Configure FaceID for each Account.

= User Accounts Security =
* Detect if there is a user account which has the default "admin" username and easily change the username to a value of your choice.
* The plugin will also detect if you have any WordPress user accounts which have identical login and display names. Having account's where display name is identical to login name is bad security practice because
you are making it 50% easier for hackers because they already know the login name.
* Password strength tool to allow you to create very strong passwords.
* Stop user enumeration. So users/bots cannot discover user info via author permalink.

= User Login Security =
* Protect against "Brute Force Login Attack" with the Login Lockdown feature. Users with a certain IP address or range will be locked out of the system for a predetermined amount of time based on the configuration settings and you can also choose to be notified
via email whenever somebody gets locked out due to too many login attempts.

* As the administrator you can view a list of all locked out users which are displayed in an easily readable and navigable table which also allows you to unlock individual or bulk IP addresses at the click of a button.
* Force logout of all users after a configurable time period
* Monitor/View failed login attempts which show the user's IP address, User ID/Username and Date/Time of the failed login attempt

* Ability to add captcha to the WordPress's user registration page to protect you from spam user registration.
* Ability to add Honeypot to the WordPress's user registration form to reduce registration attempts by robots.
